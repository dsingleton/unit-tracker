# Unit Tracking Web App

Add units consumed for a given day. Understand unit consumption over time.

## Why?

- Like the [NHS Drinks Tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/one-you-drinks-tracker/id1082307338?mt=8) as a web app, but built around my use cases, with better UI, and data export
- A toy project for a modern Frontend tech stack

## Tech stack

- Docker
- Next.js
- Jest
- React
- Redux (probably)
- CSS Modules
- ES Lint (maybe [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier))
- Service Worker

## Infrastructure
- CircleCI
- Heroku?
